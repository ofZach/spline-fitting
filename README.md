spline-fitting
==============

some small examples in OF of fitting a function w/ splines.  Very not optimized or clean... 

one example uses : eol spline (http://www.eol.ucar.edu/~granger/bspline/doc/index.html) which does uniform splines

the other example uses: http://libnurbs.sourceforge.net/    

for the libnurbs, I had a crazy amount of compiler errors, so I tried to fix the code -- there's was a fair amount of c++ template inheritance issues that I tried to resolve.  

hopefully people that are trying to get libnurbs to compile on a modern computer could be helped by this.
